# A-New-Sun-Will-Rise
A Victoria 2 Mod based off of HPM. Currently in early devolopment.
The mod is currently in Version 0.01
(This is a test version NOT COMPLETE)
Installation:
Move both the ANSWR, and ANSWR.mod files into your Victoria 2 mod folder. You can find it by going into steam, and find your copy of Victoria 2 in your libary.
Right click the game, and click on properties. From there, move to the Local Files tab, and click Browse Local Files. From there you should see the mod folder, and
you want to put the mod files.

Thank you so much for downloading my mod, it means a lot.

Common Issues:
Flags cache causes a crash on first load. Just try again, it should work the second time through.
Crash at rivers.bmp which is fixed by either deleting the map cache in documents>paradox>victoria 2>ANSWR>map, just delete that folder. That, or its an issue with map.default, and you'll want to change the "#" in the file.
